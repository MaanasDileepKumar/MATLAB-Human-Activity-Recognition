# MATLAB-Human-Activity-Recognition

Welcome to the MATLAB Human Activity Recognition project! This repository is dedicated to the development of an advanced system for analyzing and classifying human activities using MATLAB. Our work focuses on leveraging sensor data to recognize various activities such as walking, running, sitting, and more, with potential applications in health monitoring and interactive technologies.

## Project Overview

Our project involves:
- **Data Collection:** Utilizing MATLAB Mobile to gather accelerometer data directly from mobile devices.
- **Feature Extraction:** Implementing algorithms in MATLAB to extract meaningful features from raw data.
- **Model Training:** Using MATLAB's Classification Learner app to train and evaluate machine learning models.
- **Model Validation:** Testing the models with new, unseen data to ensure accuracy and robustness.
- **Application Development:** Creating a user-friendly MATLAB application for real-time activity monitoring.
